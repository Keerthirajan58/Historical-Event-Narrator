# Historical Event Narrator

**CS 6366 — Neural Networks (Final Project)**  
**Project summary:** Fine-tuning a large language model using LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) to convert Wikipedia-style historical event articles into engaging narrative stories. The model will be trained to produce variations such as "what-if" alternatives and underrepresented perspectives. The project focuses on efficiency (LoRA adapters), reproducibility, and evaluation using automatic metrics and an LLM-as-judge approach.

## 🛠️ Setup
1. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   pip install streamlit google-generativeai python-dotenv
   ```
2. **Environment Variables**:
   Ensure `.env` contains your API key:
   ```
   GEMINI_API_KEY=your_key_here
   ```

## Running the App
To run the Streamlit app:
1. Ensure you have the `results/` folder (model weights) in the root directory.
2. Set up your `.env` with `GEMINI_API_KEY`.
3. Run:
   ```bash
   streamlit run app/app.py
   ```
